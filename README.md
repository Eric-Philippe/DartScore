# ðŸŽ¯ DartScore

This project is a simple lightweight Darts Scoreboard that allows you to keep track of your scores while playing darts.
It also helps the player to calculate the remaining score, and calculate the best possible moves to finish the game.

> The logic is implemented in the `src/DartGame` folder and can be easily extended to support more platforms.
